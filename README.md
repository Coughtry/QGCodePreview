# QGCodePreview

Example previewer for rs274 gcode, using the QGCodeViewer widget

Essentially it is a cut down version of the GCoder app 
https://github.com/QGCoder/gcoder

It uses the QGCodeViewer widget and library
https://github.com/ArcEye/QGCodeViewer
for a simplified interface, with most rendering etc done behind the scenes
in the widget.
